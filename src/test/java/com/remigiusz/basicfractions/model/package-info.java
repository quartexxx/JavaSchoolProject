/*
 * Package containing classes for basic fraction operations.
 * Author: Remigiusz Kocialski
 * Version: 1.0
 * 
 * This package includes test cases for the Fraction class, covering addition, subtraction,
 * multiplication, and division operations. Additionally, it handles edge cases such as
 * invalid inputs, division by zero, and parsing exceptions.
 * 
 * The test cases use JUnit 5 with parameterized tests to ensure comprehensive coverage
 * and validate the correctness of the Fraction class functionality.
 * 
 * Note: No changes have been made to the existing code.
